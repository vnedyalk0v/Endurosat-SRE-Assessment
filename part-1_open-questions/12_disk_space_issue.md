# A Critical Server is Running Low on Disk Space. What Steps Would You Take to Free Up Space on the Server and Prevent This Issue from Recurring?

When a critical server runs low on disk space, it’s important to quickly free up space and implement preventative measures. Based on my experience with Linux, Windows, and macOS, here’s the approach I would take:

### Step 1: Identify Large Files and Directories

- **Linux**: Use `du -sh /*` to identify which directories are consuming the most space.
- **Windows**: Use tools like **TreeSize** or the built-in **Disk Cleanup** tool to locate large files.
- **macOS**: Use **Finder** or `du` in Terminal to check disk usage.

### Step 2: Clear Temporary Files

- **Linux**: Clear `/tmp` and review `/var/log` for large or old log files.
- **Windows**: Use **Disk Cleanup** to remove temporary files and old system files, or manually clear `C:\Windows\Temp`.
- **macOS**: Delete cache files in `~/Library/Caches` and system logs.

### Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Applications or Files

- **Linux**: Remove unused packages with `apt` or `yum` and delete outdated backups or archives.
- **Windows**: Uninstall unused programs via **Programs and Features** and delete old files.
- **macOS**: Delete unused apps from the **Applications** folder and clear any large, outdated files.

### Step 4: Review Backup Policies and Archive Old Data

- **All OSs**: Ensure backup policies are rotating old backups off the system, and archive old data to external or cloud storage.

### Step 5: Monitor and Automate Cleanup

- **All OSs**: Set up disk space monitoring with tools like **Nagios**, **Zabbix**, or built-in OS monitoring. Automate cleanup tasks using **cron** (Linux/macOS) or **Task Scheduler** (Windows) to prevent space issues from recurring.

### Conclusion

To resolve low disk space on a critical server, I would identify and remove large or unnecessary files, clear temporary data, uninstall unused applications, and review backup policies. To prevent future issues, I would implement automated monitoring and regular cleanup tasks across Linux, Windows, and macOS systems.
